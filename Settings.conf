# ====================================================


# This file will help you set the variables for Odyssey's 5 main scripts. 
# Note that some of these variables may not need to be changed as they are already set to various programs' recommended defaults. 
	# Changing these variables are thus optional and labeled as: "(OPTIONAL)"
# However, some of these variables (such as reference paths, working directory, and GWAS and Imputation Project Names) must be set by the user for Odyssey to function
	# Changing these variables are thus required and labeled as: "(REQUIRED)"
# Variables are listed in order of appearance and also under the script they appear in (although some are referenced more than once in several scripts)
	# In this way you may choose to fill out the variables a little at a time instead of all at once
	# If you choose to fill out Settings.conf little by little, make sure you do not run a script for which you have not filled out the necessary (REQUIRED) variables


# ===============================================================================
# ========================== Configuration Variables ============================
# ===============================================================================

# Setting up Odyssey is as easy as installing-running Singularity. Odyssey can also be run without Odyssey, however, this is not the recommended setup. Please follow the configuration instructions and pick your configuration options. Once that is complete type your configuration option in the setup variable below:


# How did you setup Odyssey? (Choose: 'One' or 'Two') (REQUIRED)
	# If you setup Odyssey to incorporate Singularity -- Option #1 -- then type 'One':
	# If you setup Odyssey independently of Singularity -- Option #2 -- then type 'Two':
		OdysseySetup="One";

# ===============================================================================
# =============================== Core Variables ================================
# ===============================================================================

	# Set Your Working Directory (i.e. specify where you put the Odyssey Folder on your system): (REQUIRED)
	# Please include a "/" on the end of your directory path as it will make the output syntax easier to read
		WorkingDir="/home/ryeller/scratch/Odyssey2.0/";
		
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#              High Performance Cluster (HPC) Control Variables: 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------		

	# Are you using a HPS (High Performance System) that utilizes a job handler?
		# If you specify "T" then a PBS header will be included on Phasing, Imputation, and GWAS analysis scripts
		# If you specify "F" then only a Bash shebang will be included on Phasing, Imputation, and GWAS analysis scripts 
			HPS_Submit="F";
	
	
	# If you set HPS_Submit="F" you may skip the remaining variables in this section:
			
	# Enter Your Email to get Notifications from your HPC: (OPTIONAL)
		Email="youremail@email.com";	
	
	# Does your system utilize Lustre Stripped Directories? (OPTIONAL)
		# Lustre stripping helps the file directories on HPS to prevent from being filled by distributing the files between harddrives
		# This is a good practice to use if available since it prevents "drive-full" errors
		# If you don't know what this is or your system doesn't utilize this feature you can safely ignore this option
		# Boolean Specify (T/F):
			LustreStrip="F";


# ===============================================================================
# ========================= Imputation Project Variables ========================
# ===============================================================================


	# Set Imputation Project Name: (REQUIRED)
	# This is the name that will identify the imputation project (by setting directory and file names) throughout the phasing and imputation processes
	# For example: "ImputationRun1"
	# NOTE: The Imputation Project Name must be a continuous string (i.e. do not include spaces)

			# The references files are:
				# Ref Genome: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz

		# NOTE: This step performs analysis on a Plink .bed/.bim/.fam file located within ./1_Target/PLACE_NEW_PROJECT_TARGET_DATA_HERE/. Ideally, this step is run after running the previous BCFToolsFixRef step -- regardless of whether BCFTools was used to prep the data -- PerformFixref="T" -- or only positional duplicates were removed -- PerformFixref="F"
		
		# If T then an interactive R script will run allowing you to visualize the following:
			# --missingness of genotypes and individuals
			# --Heterozygosity rates
			# --Related Individuals
			
		# This step will also allow you to write individual ID numbers to an exclusion list that can be used later to exclude from analysis
		
		# If F then this step will be skipped
